# My Courses Block (Old Version)

## NOTE
****************
This is the old version of the block. The new version is called "Custom Course Menu" and is located in the master branch of this repo. The block was re-named so that it can be submitted to the Moodle plugin database (there was already a block named my_courses).

This new blocks will work independently from the old. It is recommended that you delete the old my_courses block after installing the new. If you replace the old block with this one, all users will have their saved menus reset.
